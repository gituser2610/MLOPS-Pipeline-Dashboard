## 🔄 **Real-Time Features Implementation**

### Live Training Monitoring
```javascript
// Enhanced real-time training progress
TRAINING_STAGES = [
    "📥 Uploading data...",
    "🔍 Validating data quality...", 
    "⚙️ Preprocessing features...",
    "🧠 Training model...",
    "📊 Evaluating performance...",
    "✅ Training complete!"
];

// Live progress updates every 2 seconds
setInterval(updateTrainingProgress, 2000);

// Real-time accuracy updates during training
function updateLiveAccuracy() {
    // Show accuracy improving in real-time
    // Display validation scores as they're calculated
    // Update progress charts live
}
```

### System Health Monitoring
```javascript
// Real-time system monitoring
MONITOR_METRICS = {
    cpu_usage: "Live CPU percentage",
    memory_usage: "Live memory consumption", 
    active_trainings: "Number of running training jobs",
    api_response_time: "Average API latency",
    model_predictions_per_minute: "Live prediction volume",
    system_uptime: "Service availability",
    error_rate: "Live error percentage"
};

// Update every 5 seconds
setInterval(updateSystemMetrics, 5000);
```

### Activity Stream
```javascript
// Real-time activity logging
ACTIVITY_TYPES = {
    training_started: "🚀 Model training initiated",
    training_progress: "📈 Training progress: 45% complete",
    training_completed: "✅ Model training finished (94% accuracy)",
    model_deployed: "🌐 Model deployed to production",
    prediction_made: "🔮 Prediction request processed",
    system_alert: "⚠️ High memory usage detected",
    user_action: "👤 User uploaded new dataset"
};

// Live activity feed updates
websocket.onMessage(displayActivityUpdate);
```

## 💡 **Implementation Priority**

**PHASE 1 FOCUS: Build rich monitoring infrastructure FIRST**

1. **Week 1**: Core monitoring and feedback systems
2. **Week 2**: Simple input interfaces that connect to rich monitoring

This ensures the **value proposition** (rich real-time feedback) is delivered while keeping the **user experience** simple and approachable.

The monitoring system becomes the **foundation** for Phase 2 enterprise features, not an afterthought.
