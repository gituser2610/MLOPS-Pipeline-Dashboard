## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for business analysts and non-technical users.
- **Four-Step ML Pipeline**: 
  1. Upload CSV
  2. Train Model
  3. Deploy
  4. Predict
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures the reliability of your models and pipeline.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Guides you through every step of the process.
- **Production Deployment Guides**: Learn how to deploy your models in a production environment.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to provide a seamless experience:

- **FastAPI**: For building the web application.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data science and machine learning tasks.
- **CI/CD Tools**: For automation of testing and deployment.
- **No-Code Solutions**: To make machine learning accessible to all users.
- **Data Science Libraries**: Such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and others for data manipulation and model training.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MLOPS-Pipeline-Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gituser2610/MLOPS-Pipeline-Dashboard.git
   cd MLOPS-Pipeline-Dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start using the dashboard. Follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your CSV**: Use the upload button to select your CSV file.
2. **Train Your Model**: Click the "Train" button to start the model training process.
3. **Deploy the Model**: Once training is complete, deploy your model with a single click.
4. **Make Predictions**: Enter new data and click "Predict" to see results.
