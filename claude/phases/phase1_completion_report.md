# Phase 1 Completion Report - CSV Complexity Testing

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Executive Summary
Phase 1 testing has been completed successfully with all CSV datasets (simple, medium, complex) tested through the complete upload → train → predict flow. WebSocket monitoring was active during all tests, though some unexpected patterns were observed.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unexpected CPU Progression
- **Expected**: Simple < Medium < Complex
- **Actual**: 16.8% → 20.0% → 12.4%
- **Issue**: Complex dataset showed lower CPU usage than medium dataset

### 2. Training Time Anomaly
- **Expected**: Training time should increase with dataset complexity
- **Actual**: All datasets completed in ~14 seconds
- **Issue**: No significant time variation despite 8500x difference in data size

### 3. Limited WebSocket Samples
- **Issue**: Only 2 WebSocket metric samples captured per test
- **Impact**: May not be capturing full training dynamics

### 4. Memory Scaling
- **Observation**: Memory increase was relatively modest (57MB → 112MB → 107MB)
- **Note**: Complex dataset used less additional memory than medium dataset

## Optimizations Needed

1. **Extended Monitoring Duration**
   - Increase WebSocket sampling frequency
   - Ensure metrics are captured throughout entire training process

2. **Training Algorithm Investigation**
   - Investigate why training times are constant regardless of dataset size
   - May indicate early stopping or fixed iteration limits

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Profile the actual ML algorithm to understand resource usage patterns
   - Consider if the model is properly utilizing available data

4. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Verify WebSocket connection stability
   - Ensure all broadcast messages are captured

## System Cooldown
- Cooldown periods were successfully implemented between tests
- System returned to near-baseline CPU usage before proceeding

## Conclusion
Phase 1 testing infrastructure is operational and all tests executed successfully. However, the results indicate that the ML system may not be scaling resource usage as expected with dataset complexity. Further investigation is recommended in subsequent phases.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2 for deeper analysis of the test framework
- Investigate training algorithm behavior
- Enhance WebSocket monitoring capabilities
