## Test Execution Protocol

### Pre-Execution Setup
1. **System Preparation**

```bash
python tests/test_complexity_monitoring.py --dataset simple
```
**Expected Metrics**:
- CPU Peak: 15-25%
- Memory Increase: <50MB
- Training Duration: 2-5 seconds
- WebSocket Responsiveness: Excellent (⚡)

#### Step 3: Medium Dataset Processing  
**Dataset**: `test_medium.csv` (1,000 rows, 8 columns)
```bash
python tests/test_complexity_monitoring.py --dataset medium
```
**Expected Metrics**:
- CPU Peak: 30-50%
- Memory Increase: 50-150MB
- Training Duration: 15-30 seconds
- WebSocket Responsiveness: Good (✓)

#### Step 4: Complex Dataset Processing
**Dataset**: `test_complex.csv` (10,000 rows, 15 columns)
```bash
python tests/test_complexity_monitoring.py --dataset complex
```
**Expected Metrics**:
- CPU Peak: 60-80%
- Memory Increase: 150-300MB
- Training Duration: 60-120 seconds
- WebSocket Responsiveness: Fair/Poor (⚠/🐌)

#### Step 5: Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
python tests/test_complexity_monitoring.py --full-analysis
```
