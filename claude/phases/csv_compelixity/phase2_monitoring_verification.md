# Phase 2 Monitoring Points Verification

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Monitoring Points Analysis

### Captured Monitoring Points

1. **System-Level Metrics (via psutil)**
   - ✅ CPU Percentage (with 1-second interval)
   - ✅ Memory Percentage
   - ✅ Memory Used (MB)
   - ✅ Disk Usage Percentage
   - ✅ Process Count
   - ✅ Timestamp for each capture

2. **WebSocket Metrics**
   - ✅ Real-time CPU percentage
   - ✅ Real-time Memory percentage
   - ✅ Active WebSocket connections
   - ✅ WebSocket response time (ms)
   - ✅ Training completion events
   - ✅ Training failure events
   - ✅ Job ID tracking

3. **Training Metrics**
   - ✅ Upload duration
   - ✅ Training duration
   - ✅ Model accuracy
   - ✅ Job status tracking

4. **Comparison Metrics**
   - ✅ Pre-training baseline
   - ✅ Post-training measurements
   - ✅ CPU increase calculation
   - ✅ Memory increase calculation
   - ✅ Peak value identification

### Monitoring Coverage

| Metric Type | Coverage | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| CPU Usage | ✅ Complete | Both system and WebSocket sources |
| Memory Usage | ✅ Complete | Percentage and absolute values |
| Disk Usage | ✅ Captured | Not actively used in analysis |
| Process Count | ✅ Captured | Baseline tracking |
| Training Time | ✅ Complete | Start to completion |
| Upload Time | ✅ Complete | File transfer duration |
| WebSocket Health | ✅ Complete | Connection count, response time |
| Model Performance | ✅ Complete | Accuracy reported |

### Monitoring Gaps Identified

1. **Limited WebSocket Samples**
   - Issue: Only 2 samples captured per training session
   - Expected: Continuous monitoring throughout training
   - Impact: May miss peak usage periods

2. **Missing Metrics**
   - Network I/O not captured
   - GPU usage not monitored (if applicable)
   - Thread/process-specific metrics not tracked

3. **Timing Granularity**
   - WebSocket broadcast frequency appears low
   - May benefit from higher sampling rate

### Verification Results

✅ **Successfully Captured**:
- All critical system metrics
- Training lifecycle events
- WebSocket connection health
- Resource utilization changes

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**:
- Increase WebSocket metric frequency
- Add network I/O monitoring
- Consider GPU metrics if available
- Implement per-process monitoring

## Conclusion

The monitoring implementation successfully captures all essential metrics across system, WebSocket, and training domains. The architecture provides comprehensive visibility into system behavior during ML operations. The primary limitation is the low frequency of WebSocket metric broadcasts, which should be addressed to ensure complete capture of system dynamics during training.
