# Phase 1: Analysis and Requirements

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Single Page Application**: Currently index.html contains all dashboard functionality
- **Settings Page**: Separate settings.html exists but disconnected from main app
- **Inline Everything**: All JavaScript and CSS embedded in HTML files
- **No Routing**: Server-side page serving only
- **No Component System**: Duplicate code between pages

### Original Design Requirements (5 Pages)
Based on the original proposal and UI mockups:

1. **Dashboard** (index.html) - ✅ Exists
   - System overview
   - Key metrics
   - Activity feed
   - Quick actions

2. **MLOps Pipeline** - ❌ Missing
   - Pipeline creation and management
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Pipeline history
   - Stage visualization

3. **AI Architecture** - ❌ Missing
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Component overview
   - Integration points
   - System topology

4. **Data Management** - ❌ Missing
   - Dataset listing
   - Data profiling
   - Upload management
   - Data versioning

5. **Monitoring** - ❌ Missing
   - Detailed system metrics
   - Performance charts
   - Resource utilization
   - Alert management

### Shared Requirements Across Pages

#### Visual Consistency
- Consistent navigation bar
- Unified color scheme and design system
- Common card and button styles
- Shared status indicators

#### Functional Requirements
- WebSocket connection maintained across pages
- Activity feed updates visible on all pages
- System status always visible
- Settings applied globally

#### Technical Requirements
- Shared authentication (future)
- Common API client
- Centralized error handling
- Consistent loading states

### Constraints & Considerations

1. **Maintain Simplicity**: Keep vanilla JavaScript approach
2. **Preserve Functionality**: Don't break existing features
3. **WebSocket Continuity**: Connection must persist across navigation
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Pages should work independently
5. **No Framework**: Continue without React/Vue as per current approach

### Success Criteria

1. Clean separation of shared vs page-specific code
2. Easy navigation between all 5 pages
3. Consistent user experience
4. Maintainable file structure
5. No duplicate code
6. WebSocket connection maintained
7. Fast page transitions
8. Clear active page indication
